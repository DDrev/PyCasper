Welcome to UberCarrot
=====================

UberCarrot is created from two different parts:
* The UberCarrot main project itself, which is primarily a :term:`CasparCG` client that allows a user to use CasparCG as a graphics machine. Read more about that in :doc:`intro`.
* The backend to UberCarrot, a python module called :py:mod:`CasparTalk`. This provides a rough Python wrapper around the AMCP commands used by CasparCG, as well as a user- and developer- friendly way of implementing them. Read more at :doc:`CasparTalk`.
