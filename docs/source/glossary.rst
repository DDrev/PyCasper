    CasparCG
        Open-source software developed by SVT, designed to play video content to a number of outputs, but can also manipulate the video's colour and spatial properties, as well as playing Flash- and HTML-based templates out, so as to be able to create keyed graphics.
        See `CasparCG Server <http://casparcg.com>`_ for more details.

    Graphics machine
        Primarily used in TV, a character generator (CG) is a computer that creates on-screen graphics that can be keyed over an image. Some of then most common graphics that CGs create include lower-third straps (that might show the name of a TV presenter) or leaderboards in sports programmes.
